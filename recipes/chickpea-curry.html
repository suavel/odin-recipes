    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>This Easy Chickpea curry is the perfect weeknight dinner: it’s quick and easy to make, it comes together in one pot, and it uses staple pantry ingredients so you can make curry any time the craving hits. By the way, this recipe packs in some serious flavor, but it doesn’t require any hard-to-find spices, and it’s loaded with protein and fiber! Even the most adamant carnivores won’t miss the meat in this vegan-friendly dish.</p>
